This folder contains the json files that were on the iSchool's saab server under 
```/export/home/u09/unmil/ComputationalCollectionDescriptions/data/july2016.```

-provderInfo (sic) files contain information about how many dataProviders contribute to a Provider. These are tiny files.

("provder" is a typo.  It should be "provider".)

The file dpla-base-data.json contains high-level statistics about all the items in the DPLA.
